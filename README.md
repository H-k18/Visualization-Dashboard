# Data Visualization Dashboard

This project is an interactive data visualization dashboard that displays insights from a JSON dataset. It uses a Flask backend to serve data from an SQLite database and a frontend built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and D3.js for rendering visualizations.

## Features

- **Interactive Charts:** Visualizes data such as intensity, likelihood, relevance, year, country, topics, region, etc.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Allows users to filter data based on:
    - End Year
    - Topic
    - Sector
    - Region
    - PESTLE
    - Source
    - Country
- **SQLite Database:** Processes and stores data from a JSON file.
- **Flask Backend:** Provides APIs to fetch data and filter options.
- **D3.js Visualizations:** Renders various charts including bar charts, line charts, and donut charts.
- **Responsive Design:** The dashboard is designed to be usable across different screen sizes.
- **Modern UI:** Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and professional look.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
    - Python
    - Flask (for web framework and API)
    - SQLite3 (for database)
- **Frontend:**
    - HTML
    - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
    - JavaScript
    - D3.js (for data visualization)
- **Data Handling:**
    - JSON

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- `pip` (Python package installer).

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository (or Download Files):**
    If this project were in a Git repository, you would clone it. For now, ensure all the provided files (`jsondata.json`, `data_setup.py`, `app.py`, and the `templates` folder with `index.html`) are in the same project directory.

2.  **Place your Data:**
    Ensure your `jsondata.json` file is in the root of the project directory.

3.  **Install Dependencies (Flask):**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and install Flask:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask Flask-CORS
    ```
    (`Flask-CORS` is used in `app.py` to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, which is good practice for APIs).

4.  **Create and Populate the Database:**
    Run the `data_setup.py` script to create the `dashboard_data.db` SQLite database and populate it with data from your `jsondata.json` file:
    ```bash
    python data_setup.py
    ```
    Follow any on-screen prompts (e.g., if the database already exists and has data).

## How to Run the Application

1.  **Start the Flask Backend Server:**
    Once the database is set up, run the `app.py` script to start the Flask development server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    By default, the application will be served at `http://127.0.0.1:5001/`. The terminal will show the exact address.

2.  **Access the Dashboard:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    [http://127.0.0.1:5001/](http://127.0.0.1:5001/)
    ```

You should now see the Data Visualization Dashboard with interactive charts and filters.

## API Endpoints

The Flask application (`app.py`) provides the following API endpoints:

-   **`GET /`**: Serves the main `index.html` dashboard page.
-   **`GET /api/filters`**: Returns a JSON object containing unique values for each filter dropdown (e.g., distinct topics, regions, sectors).
-   **`GET /api/data`**: Returns the main dataset for the charts. It accepts query parameters to filter the data based on user selections.
    -   Example: `/api/data?topic=technology&region=Northern%20America`

## Dashboard Visualizations

The dashboard currently includes the following charts:

1.  **Average Intensity by Topic (Top 10)**: Bar chart.
2.  **Average Likelihood by Region (Top 10)**: Bar chart.
3.  **Average Relevance by Sector (Top 10)**: Bar chart.
4.  **Number of Insights by End Year**: Line chart.
5.  **PESTLE Distribution**: Donut chart.
6.  **Top Countries by Insights (Top 10)**: Bar chart.
7.  **Top Sources by Insights (Top 10)**: Bar chart.

## Customization and Future Enhancements

-   **Add More Filters:** Extend filtering capabilities (e.g., by city, SWOT analysis if data is available and structured appropriately).
-   **New Chart Types:** Implement different D3.js visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, scatter plots, word clouds, choropleth maps for geographical data).
-   **Advanced Interactivity:** Add features like drill-down on charts or cross-filtering (clicking a chart element updates other charts/filters).
-   **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Enhance `data_setup.py` for more sophisticated data cleaning or transformation logic if needed.
-   **User Authentication:** If the dashboard needs to be private.
-   **Deployment:** Deploy the Flask application using a production-ready web server (e.g., Gunicorn, Waitress) and a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx).
-   **Testing:** Add unit tests for the backend and potentially UI tests for the frontend.
